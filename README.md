# imgoose

> A Ruby on Rails project

This project enables users to have similar functionality found on [imgur.com](https://imgur.com/). Signing up enables users to upload images, which in turn tracks the user id associated with it, its file name, the date created, the image size, and a large download button for a direct link to the image itself.

There is also a public gallery page (Browse) which lists all the images uploaded by any user.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install gems/dependencies
$ bundle install

# run build
$ rails s
```
Live demo can be found on [here on Heroku](https://damp-basin-20315.herokuapp.com/). <br><br>
